# Customer Churn Prediction Project

### Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting **customer churn** for a telecommunications company using historical customer data. Customer churn refers to customers who discontinue their service. Predicting churn helps businesses proactively retain customers and reduce revenue loss.

The dataset contains customer demographic information, subscribed services, billing details, and churn status. Machine learning techniques are applied to identify patterns and key drivers of churn.


### Objectives

* Understand customer behavior and churn drivers
* Prepare and preprocess data for modeling
* Build a predictive churn model
* Evaluate model performance
* Provide actionable business insights


### Dataset Description

The dataset includes:

* Customer demographics (e.g., gender, senior citizen status)
* Account information (tenure, contract type, payment method)
* Services used (internet, streaming, tech support)
* Financial metrics (monthly and total charges)
* Target variable: **Churn (Yes / No)**


### Tools & Technologies

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib / Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook


### Workflow

1. Data loading and inspection
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
4. Feature encoding and scaling
5. Train-test split with shuffling and stratification
6. Model training and evaluation
7. Interpretation of results


### Expected Outcome

A predictive model capable of identifying customers at high risk of churn, along with insights that support retention strategies.
